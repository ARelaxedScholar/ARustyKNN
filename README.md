# Rust-Based K-Nearest Neighbors - Step 1 in Rust-Based Neural Network.

Welcome to my journey of building a neural network from scratch using Rust and its standard libraries.

## Why Rust?
I'm passionate about AI and believe that the best way to truly understand it is to code its inner workings from the ground up. I figured translating/writing code written for the hegemon of the AI world (python)
to Rust would give me proper understanding of everything. Also, I am learning it and will be reading the Rust-lang book as I am writing this.

## About Me
I'm a newcomer to Rust, and I'm excited to document my progress as I work through this project. By the end of this journey, which will likely span multiple steps, I aim to become proficient in Rust and gain a deep understanding of neural networks.

## Coding K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
As part of my learning process, I've decided to start with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a fundamental machine learning algorithm. Implementing KNN in Rust will not only help me understand the language but also reinforce my understanding of machine learning concepts. Stay tuned for updates on my KNN journey within this larger project. Join me on this exciting adventure!

## KNN project (complete) Step 1/X Complete!
- KNN itself is done, the current implementation works and I will work on it on a need to basis.
I didn't watch the code implementation since I already had an idea how it would make sense to implement it,
but this channel is amazing and much too small. Give it a look. The idea to code KNN comes from there >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=258u1CVlYvs


## Stuff to add
- Proper documentation and doctests for the linear algebra methods
- Implementation of matrices
- Implementation of generics for the vector (currently only accepts floats)
